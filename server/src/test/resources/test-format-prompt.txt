When writing JUnit tests for this project, follow these conventions:

1. One scenario per method. Method names must start with `test` and use camel case (e.g. `testHandlesEmptyInput`).
2. Annotate every test with `@DisplayName("â€¦")` describing the behaviour under test.
3. Structure each test body with the comments `//Given`, `//When`, `//Then`. Immediately below each comment add a short sentence describing what is being prepared, executed, or asserted.
4. Build domain objects using real constructors/setters; introduce private helper methods inside the test class only when this improves readability.
5. Assert precise outcomes that demonstrate the scenario. Avoid verifying logging.
6. Use JUnit
7. Place new test sources in the appropriate `src/.../test/java` tree.
